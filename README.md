This repository contains the data associated with the scientific article titled "Comparative Intestine Microbiome Dynamics of the Earthworm Eisenia fetida Cultivated in Sewage Sludge and Peat". The data is organized into two main folders: `pictures` and `tables`.

## Repository Structure
**`pictures`**
This folder contains graphical representations of the data presented in the article. These graphs illustrate various aspects of the microbiome dynamics observed in the intestines of Eisenia fetida cultivated in different substrates.

**`tables`**
This folder includes the source tables used for statistical analysis in the study. The following files are available:

* asv_table.csv: Contains the Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) table used for microbiome analysis.
* metadata.csv: Provides metadata associated with the samples, including experimental conditions and sample identifiers.
* taxonomy.csv: Lists the taxonomic classification of the ASVs.
* supplementary_tables.xlsx: An Excel file containing supplementary tables that provide additional data and insights.

## Data Description
The data in this repository enables a comprehensive analysis of the microbiome composition and dynamics within the intestines of Eisenia fetida. The earthworms were cultivated in two different substrates: sewage sludge and peat. The study aims to compare the microbial communities in these environments and understand their implications for vermicomposting.

### Graphs
The graphs in the `pictures` folder include, but are not limited to:

* Relative abundance plots of major microbial taxa.
* Diversity indices comparing microbiome diversity between the two substrates.
* Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) plots
* Microbiome community compositions

### Source Tables
The source tables in the `tables` folder are crucial for reproducing the statistical analyses presented in the article. They include detailed information on:

* The presence and abundance of microbial taxa (asv_table.csv).
* Experimental metadata (metadata.csv) that contextualizes the microbiome data.
* Taxonomic classifications (taxonomy.csv) that provide a framework for understanding microbial identities and relationships.
* Additional data (additional_tables.xlsx) that support extended analyses and interpretations.
